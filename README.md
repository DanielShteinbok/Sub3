# Sub3 Smart Contracts
These are the smart contracts for the Sub3 project, written for EthSF 2022.
The objective of this project is to create a platform for risk-free management of recurring payments for subscription services.

This simple smart contract allows for users to add payees, specifying how much they can withdraw and how often.
This should not allow service providers, or payees to take payment more frequently than agreed upon.

Users can cancel the recurring payments any time.
